## General Information

Reddit Client is a dark mode alternative to the reddit website. Based on a selection of subreddits, the reddit client will update the posts rendered based on the top posts of the website. The client does not allow the user to add posts or comments, but allows them to browse and read through the various subreddits.

## Features

- Fetches information from the Reddit API and renders the subreddits and posts accordingly.
- Changes the posts rendered based on the selected subreddit.
- Can expand and view the top comments within each post by clicking the comment button.
- Displays the current score of the respective posts.

## Project Status

The project is materially complete, but can still be further refined. See room for improvement section for additional information.

## Room for Imrpovement

- Filter posts based on search term; search bar has not yet been incorporated in order to have this functionality.
- Include information of when the post was posted to Reddit and when the comments were made.

## Acknowledgment

The project was provided by Codecademy as part of their Full Stack Web Development curriculum.
